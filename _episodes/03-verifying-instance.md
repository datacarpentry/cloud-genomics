# Is this the right cloud?

Once you're connected to your new remote instance, it's a good idea to double check that
the settings are what you wanted, and that everything is working smoothly before you start
your project.

For this workshop, your instructor did all the verification before the workshop
even started, but this is an important skill for when you start running your own instances.


## Verifying your connection

When you connect, it is typical to receive a welcome screen. The Data Carpentry Amazon instances display this message upon connecting:

## Verifying your environment

Now that we have connected here are a few commands that tell you a little about the machine you have connected to:

- `whoami` - shows your username on computer you have connected to:

~~~
$ whoami

{: .bash}

~~~
dcuser
~~~
{: .output}

-  `df -h` - shows space on hard drive*

## Staying Connected to the Cloud

Depending on how you connect to the cloud, you may have processes and jobs that are
running, and will need to continue running for some time. If you have connected to your
cloud desktop via VNC, jobs you start will continue to run. If you are connecting via SSH,
if you end the SSH connection (e.g. you exit your SSH session, you lose your connection
to the internet, you close your laptop, etc.), jobs that are still running when you
disconnect will be killed. There are a few ways to keep cloud processes running in the background.
Many times when we refer to a background process we are talking about what is
[described at this tutorial](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-command-line-run-in-background/) -
running a command and returning to shell prompt. Here we describe a program that will
allow us to run our entire shell and keep that process running even if we disconnect: `tmux`. If you don't have `tmux` on your system, you should still be able to use `screen`, instructions for which are provided below.

### tmux


#### Starting and attaching to `tmux` sessions

**Starting a new session**

A 'session' can be thought of as a window for `tmux`, you might open an terminal to do one thing on the a computer and then open a new terminal to work on another task at the command line. You can start a session and give it a descriptive name:

~~~
$ tmux new -s session_name
~~~
{: .bash} 

This creates a session with the name 'session_name'

As you work, this session will stay active until you close this session. Even if you disconnect from your machine, the jobs you start in this session will run till completion.

**Detach session (process keeps running in background)**

You can detach from a tmux session by pressing `control + b` followed by `d` (for detach) on your keyboard.

**Seeing active sessions**

If you disconnect from your session, or from your ssh into a machine, you will need to reconnect to an existing `tmux` session. You can see a list of existing sessions:

~~~
$ tmux list-sessions
~~~
{: .bash} 

**Connecting to a session**

To connect to an existing session:

~~~
$ tmux attach -t session_name
~~~
{: .bash} 

The `-t` option = 'target'

**Switch sessions**
You can switch between sessions:

~~~
$ tmux switch -t session_name
~~~
{: .bash}

**Kill a session**
You can end sessions:

~~~
$ tmux kill-session -t session_name
~~~
{: .bash}

### screen

This is another program that has mostly the same capabilities as tmux. It's a lot older, though, so can be more clunky to use; however, it is likely to be available on any cloud system you encounter.

#### Starting and attaching to `screen` sessions

**Starting a new session**

A 'session' can be thought of as a window for `screen`, you might open an terminal to do one thing on the a computer and then open a new terminal to work on another task at the command line. You can start a session and give it a descriptive name:

~~~
$ screen -S session_name
~~~
{: .bash}

This creates a session with the name 'session_name'

As you work, this session will stay active until you close this session. Even if you disconnect from your machine, the jobs you start in this session will run till completion.

**Detach session (process keeps running in background)**

You can detach from a session by pressing `control + a` followed by `d` (for detach) on your keyboard. 

**Seeing active sessions**

If you disconnect from your session, or from your ssh into a machine, you will need to reconnect to an existing `screen` session. You can see a list of existing sessions:

~~~
$ screen -ls
~~~
{: .bash}

**Reconnecting to a session**

To reconnect to an existing session:

~~~
$ screen -r session_name
~~~
{: .bash}

The `-r` option = 'resume  a detached screen session'

**Kill a session**

To end a session, type `exit` after reconnecting to the session:

~~~
$ screen -r session_name
$ exit
~~~
{: .bash}

### Installing additional software

By default `tmux` is not installed in most cloud linux instances. However you can install new software packages using Package Managers like YUM (for Red Hat and Centos instances) or APT (for Debian or Ubuntu instances). We will explore how to install `tmux` using APT (Advanced Package Tool).


#### Searching and installing software using APT

**Update APT**

Before installing or upgrading any system packages, you should always update the local APT cache:

~~~
$ sudo apt-get update
Hit:1 http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial InRelease
Get:2 http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates InRelease [102 kB]
...
Fetched 3,413 kB in 1s (2,233 kB/s)
Reading package lists... Done
$
~~~
{: .bash}

**Search for APT packages using including software**

Most common software tools will have a package named the same, but this is not always the case. If you know the name of the program you wish to install, but are not sure of the package name, you can use the `apt` program to search packages:

~~~
$ sudo apt search tmux
Sorting... Done
Full Text Search... Done
abduco/xenial 0.1-2 amd64
  terminal session manager

powerline/xenial-updates 2.3-1ubuntu0 amd64
  prompt and statusline utility

tmate/xenial 1.8.10-2build1 amd64
  terminal multiplexer with instant terminal sharing

tmux/xenial,now 2.1-3build1 amd64
  terminal multiplexer

tmuxinator/xenial 0.7.0-2 all
  Create and manage tmux sessions easily
$
~~~
{: .bash}

There is a plain `tmux` package, so we will use that to install.

**Install packages using APT**

Once you know the package name, you can install it using `apt-get install`:

~~~
$ sudo apt-get install tmux

When this has completed, `tmux` will now be available for use on the instance.
