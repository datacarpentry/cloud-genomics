### What are some of reasons to access a remote computer system?

 * Your computer does not have enough resources to run the desired analysis (memory, processors, disk space, network bandwidth).
 * You want to produce results faster than your computer can.
 * You cannot install software in your computer (application does not have support for your operating system, conflicts with other existing applications)

### Main Computational Resources

 * Find how much disk space is available in your system:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ssh account@datacarpentry.host
df -h
```

 * Find how many cores and processors are available in your system:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
cat /proc/cpuinfo
```

 * Find how many processes are running in your system, and how much resources is each consuming:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
top
```

 * Find how long it takes to run an application:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
time <your_application>
```

### Distributed System Definitions and stacks:
  (Note that many definitions exist for these terms)

 * Distributed application: an application that can be executed on a distributed system platform (e.g., mpiBLAST)
 * Distributed system platform: software layers that facilitates coordination and management of a distributed system (e.g., queue-based system, and MapReduce)
 * Distributed system:
   * High Performance Computing (HPC): large assemble of physical machines and a homogeneous operating system (e.g., your institutions' HPC, XSEDE's HPC)
   * Cloud Computing: virtual machines, distributed platforms and/or applications offered as a service (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Computing)

 * Virtual machine (VM): software computer that like a physical computer can run an operating system and applications
 * Operating system (OS): the basic software layer that allows execution and management of applications
 * Physical machine: the hardware (processors, memory, disk and network)

### HPC vs. Cloud:

| HPC | Cloud |
|:----|:------|
| User account on the system | root account on the system |
| Limited control of the system | Full control of the system |
| Central shared file system | Local file system |
| Jobs submitted into a queue | Jobs executed on each resource |
| Account-based isolation | OS-based isolation |
| Batch-oriented execution of applications | support for batch or interactive applications |
| Request for resource and time allocation | Pay-per-use |
| etc. | etc.|
