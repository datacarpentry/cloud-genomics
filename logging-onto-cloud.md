## Logging onto a cloud instance

Prerequisites:
* Knowledge about cyberinfrastructure
* Access to a cloud instance (in the form of a IP address and *.pem file containing a public key)

Objectives:
1.  Identify the "address" of your cloud instance
2.  Obtain the permission to access your cloud instance
3.  Log in to your cloud instance

### Obtaining your own cloud instance address
Your instructors will provide you with a unique public domain name system (DNS) which is the "address" of your personal cloud instance.  On the Amazon cloud, an example of a public DNS is:  ec2-54-205-96-232.compute.amazonaws.com.  This address was obtained by purchasing the rental of a cloud instance.  In this lesson, we have purchased and configured your cloud instance.  In the future, you may want to do this yourself and [here](http://angus.readthedocs.org/en/2014/amazon/start-up-an-ec2-instance.html) are some helpful instructions.

### Getting the "keys" for your cloud instance
Your instructors will also provide you with a permissions file.  You will need to download this file onto your personal computer, noting the location where it is located.

### Logging into your cloud instance
Depending on your operating system, you will need to prepare this file for accessing your cloud instance.  The first step will involve setting the permissions on your downloaded file. The second step is commands or programs to log into your instance.

*Note these are just placeholders and we can personalize these in the future.
